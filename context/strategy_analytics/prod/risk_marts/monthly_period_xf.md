## Model: `monthly_period_xf`

`monthly_period_xf`

*   **Unique ID:** `model.cherry_data_model.monthly_period_xf`
*   **FQN:** `prod.risk_marts.monthly_period_xf`
*   **Description:** **Comprehensive Monthly Loan Performance Analytics with Cumulative Metrics**
This model serves as Cherry's primary monthly loan performance tracking table for the credit risk team, providing both period-specific and cumulative loan performance metrics. It extends  `stg_monthly_period_without_cumulative` by adding cumulative calculations across loan lifecycles using  window functions partitioned by loan_id and ordered by period_number.
**Key Business Logic:** - **Monthly Period Structure**: Each loan gets one record per month from funding through current period - **Cumulative Calculations**: Adds running totals for finance charges, principal payments, fees, charge-offs, 
  and recoveries using window functions over loan lifecycles
- **Beginning/End of Period Snapshots**: Captures loan status, balances, and delinquency at period boundaries - **Charge-Off Integration**: Handles charge-off timing and sets appropriate balances to zero post charge-off - **Risk Performance Metrics**: Tracks delinquency buckets, days past due, and charge-off categories
**Critical Data Sources:** - `stg_monthly_period_skeleton`: Base period structure generating monthly intervals for each funded loan - `daily_loan_xf`: Beginning and end-of-month loan status snapshots for balance and delinquency tracking - `stg_loanpro_charges`: Monthly fee assessments, waivers, and processing fees - Monthly payment aggregations: Principal and interest collections by loan and period - Charge-off data: GUCO/GACO calculations by category (fraud, bankruptcy, deceased, early vs. total) - Recovery data: Post-charge-off collections and net charge-off calculations
**Primary Use Cases:** - Monthly loan portfolio performance analysis and vintage tracking - Cumulative loss analysis and charge-off rate calculations - Collection effectiveness measurement and recovery analysis - Regulatory reporting and credit risk assessment - Loan performance trending and cohort analysis
