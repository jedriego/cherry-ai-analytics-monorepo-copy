*   **FQN:** `prod.revenue_marts.scaling_sales_metrics_xf`
*   **Description:** **Daily Sales Performance Analytics by User and Attribution Source**
This model provides a comprehensive daily time series of sales performance metrics at the individual  user level across attribution sources, designed to support detailed sales performance monitoring,  capacity planning, and individual contributor analysis. It creates a complete scaffold of active  Sales/Account Executive users by date and tracks their qualified opportunity generation and  conversion performance across multiple attribution channels.
**Key Business Logic:** - **Complete User-Date Scaffold**: Creates every date for every active Sales/AE user to ensure consistent reporting - **Historical Role Tracking**: Uses seed data as primary source with Salesforce historical data as fallback - **Attribution Mapping**: Tracks 6 attribution sources (Sales, Alle, Sales Development, Marketing, Business Development, Practice Development, Other) - **Multi-Window Conversion**: Tracks go-live conversion rates at 14, 30, and 60-day windows from qualified opportunity - **Department Filtering**: Focuses on Sales and Account Executive departments only
**Attribution Sources:** - **Sales**: Direct sales team generated opportunities - **Alle**: Partnership-driven opportunities from Alle collaboration   - **Sales Development**: SDR/BDR generated qualified opportunities - **Marketing**: Marketing-driven inbound and campaign opportunities - **Business Development**: Strategic partnership and channel opportunities - **Practice Development**: Practice development team opportunities - **Other**: Miscellaneous sources not fitting primary categories
**Primary Use Cases:** - Individual sales representative performance tracking and analysis - Team capacity planning and headcount correlation with pipeline generation - Attribution source performance comparison at the user level - Conversion funnel analysis by sales representative and attribution source - Sales coaching and performance improvement identification - Territory and user-level go-live rate benchmarking
**Data Sources:** - **calendar_table_xf**: Complete calendar dimension for time series construction - **stg_sf_users & sf_user_history**: Salesforce user data with historical role tracking - **pursuit_engagement_summary**: Pursuit-level engagement attribution and milestone tracking - **prospect_attribution_summary**: Prospect-level attribution rolled up from pursuits
