## Model: `organization_monthly_volume_xf`

`organization_monthly_volume_xf`

*   **Unique ID:** `model.cherry_data_model.organization_monthly_volume_xf`
*   **FQN:** `prod.core_marts.organization_monthly_volume_xf`
*   **Description:** Monthly time series model that tracks gross transaction volume by organization, providing a comprehensive view of organizational performance over time. This model creates a complete monthly skeleton for each organization starting from their first merchant go-live date through the current month, ensuring consistent time series reporting with zero-filled months where no transactions occurred. The model focuses on active, non-demo merchants with funded loans to provide accurate business performance metrics. It serves as a key reporting table for organizational growth analysis, performance tracking, and trend identification by providing monthly gross transaction volumes across all organizations. The model uses the first merchant go-live date as the organization's inception point and includes all subsequent months to enable comprehensive historical analysis and growth trajectory tracking.

    | `GO_LIVE_MONTH` | 3 | `DATE` | First day of the month when the organization's first merchant went live, calculated as DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', go_live_date) from the earliest merchant go-live date for the organization. This represents the organization's inception point in the system and serves as the starting point for the monthly time series. Used for calculating organization tenure and filtering the time series to begin from the relevant operational start date.

    | `TOTAL_GROSS_TRANSACTIONS` | 4 | `FLOAT` | Total gross transaction amount for the organization in the specified calendar month, calculated as the sum of gross_amount from all funded loans originated by the organization's merchants during that month. This metric represents the total lending volume generated by all merchant locations within the organization. Uses ZEROIFNULL to ensure months with no transaction activity are represented as zero rather than null, enabling accurate time series analysis and trend calculations. Critical for measuring organizational growth, performance tracking, and business development analysis. | Total gross transaction amount for the organization in the specified calendar month, calculated as the sum of gross_amount from all funded loans originated by the organization's merchants during that month.
